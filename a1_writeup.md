# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

So far, I think that python is much simpler and more user friendly that swift was. It i not as complicated and I find it easier to learn.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Swift had a lot more things you had to do to make code work and it was really finnicky. Ex. In swift you have to use parenthesis for loops and stuff but here you can just do indentations and it is much less confusing.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I feel like I learned a lot of the basics through this assignment, like structures, lists, and simple commands like print. I am excited to delve further into python and do more complicated things.
